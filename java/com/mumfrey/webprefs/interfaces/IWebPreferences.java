/**
 * Web-based preferences, objects implementing this interface represent a remote asychronous Key/Value
 * store which fetches and commits values on a best-effort basis.
 * 
 * Values in this store are not guaranteed to be correct, nor are values written to the store guaranteed to
 * be successfully written to the store.
 * 
 * In general, consumers should call get() and set() with the assumption that reads and writes will happen
 * asynchronously, eg. they should continually poll get() rather than caching any responses returned from the
 * preferences object.
 * 
 * Behaviour is such that any call to has() or get() will trigger asynchronous retrieval of properties from
 * the backend server. Likewise calls to set() will trigger asychronous commit of dirty values (both reads
 * and sets are batched and sent to the server as a single request where possible).
 * 
 * Keys in the collection are restricted to lowercase letters and the period symbol only, failure to adhere
 * to this format will cause any accessor methods to throw InvalidKeyException. Values in the collection are
 * strings and are limited to 255 characters and must not be null, failure to adhere to these restrictions
 * will cause accessors to throw InvalidValueException.
 * 
 * Consumers can trigger synchronisation events on the collection using convenience methods, these methods do
 * not ensure propagation of settings but act can be used to alter the normal behaviour of the set when
 * necessary, for example to poll for updated values periodically. The methods request(), poll() and commit()
 * can be used to trigger synchronisation events, consult the javadoc for each method for more details.

	 *  + You may wish to indicate to the set that it should request an updated value from the server for a
	 *    key which it already has (normally values are cached indefinitely).

/**
 * Web-based preferences, objects implementing this interface represent a remote
 * asychronous Key/Value store which fetches and commits values on a best-effort
 * basis.
 *
 * <p>Values in this store are not guaranteed to be correct, nor are values
 * written to the store guaranteed to be successfully written to the store.
 *
 * <p>In general, consumers should call {@link #get} and {@link #set} with the
 * assumption that reads and writes will happen asynchronously, eg. they should
 * continually poll {@link #get} rather than caching any responses returned
 * from the preferences object.</p>
 *
 * <p>Behaviour is such that any call to {@link #has} or {@link #get} will
 * trigger asynchronous retrieval of properties from the backend server.
 * Likewise calls to {@link #set} will trigger asychronous commit of dirty
 * values (both reads and sets are batched and sent to the server as a single
 * request where possible).</p>
 *
 * <p>Keys in the collection are restricted to lowercase letters and the period
 * symbol only, failure to adhere to this format will cause any accessor methods
 * to throw InvalidKeyException. Values in the collection are strings and are
 * limited to 255 characters and must not be null, failure to adhere to these
 * restrictions will cause accessors to throw {@link InvalidValueException}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Consumers can trigger synchronisation events on the collection using
 * convenience methods, these methods do not ensure propagation of settings but
 * act can be used to alter the normal behaviour of the set when necessary, for
 * example to poll for updated values periodically. The methods request(),
 * poll() and commit() can be used to trigger synchronisation events, consult
 * the javadoc for each method for more details.</p>
